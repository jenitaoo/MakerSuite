# MakerSuite
## 📌 Project Status: Active Development (Final-Year Project)
This repository contains the ongoing development of **MakerSuite**, a web-based cross‑listing and inventory management tool for makers and small creative businesses. The goal of the project is to provide a unified workflow for creating, managing, and synchronising product listings across multiple platforms as well as provide inventory management.
